This is initial commit for the project, this project is a client side application for ordering pizza. 
Using firebase as a place to store and pull the information for the app.
this application can do some basic function like sign in, sign up, check the status of the order, place order, sign out.

Since the main focus for this project is to be able to place order through voice control, we use the google cloud speech api to deal with
it. The goolge cloud speech api is ready, what left is to merge the two together which will be done in later commit.
Later commit, if we have time will also add the option to pay, adding the google map into the application
